        <h3>Lists with pictures - what a novel idea!</h3>

      <p>I don't know about you but I find most List creation apps - well - kind of boring. I wanted something with a little color to make it easier for me to easily and quickly pick out one list from another. The same goes for when I'm working with a list, for example my grocery list. I wanted to be able to see what was in my list with less fuss and more fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other problem I had with the list apps I tried is how much of a pain it could be to create and edit lists. I wanted something that was fast and easy. More importantly I wanted my app to remember the things I used in my lists so I could re-use them in new lists. 
      </p>
      <p>So - I created Picklist (get it: <u>lists</u> with <u>pict</u>ures ;-).

      <h3>So what does it look like?</h3>

      <p>Well - here are some screenshots:</p>
