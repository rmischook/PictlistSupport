        <h3>Lists with pictures - what a novel idea!</h3>

      <p>I've tried quite a few list-management apps and - to be honest - have mostly found them to be kind of boring. I wanted something with a little color, to make it easier for me to easily and quickly pick out one list from another. The same goes for when I'm working with a list, for example my grocery list. I wanted to be able to see what was in my list with less fuss and more fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other problem I had with the list apps I tried is how much of a pain it could be to create and edit lists. I wanted something that was fast and easy. I wanted the app to remember the things I used in my lists, so I could re-use them in new lists later. 
      </p>
      <p>So - I created Pictlist (<u>lists</u> with <u>pict</u>ures ;-).

      <h3>So what does it look like?</h3>

      <p>Well - here are some screenshots:</p>

      <div style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 80%;">
        <img src="images/iphone_6_home_screen.png" height=400>
        <img src="images/iphone_6_movies.png" height=400>
        <img src="images/iphone_6_godfather.png" height=400>
        <img src="images/iphone_6_godfather_select.png" height=400>
      </div>

      <p>When you create a new list, or add something to a list, Pictlist automatically uses Web image search to try and find a matching image, and saves the first match. If you want to pick another image you can do that anytime.</p>

      <h4>Other features:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Tags: you can tag your items to enable sorting and to make searching for them later easier.</li>
        <li>Sharing: you can share your lists as a read-only Email using the standard iOS share sheet. </li>
        <li>No advertizing, no Push Notification, no unlocked stuff.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Future Features:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Share &amp; Sync with other Pictlist users: share a common list and see updates other users make</li>
        <li>You tell me ;-) </li>
      </ul>

      <p>If there is enough interest in the App I may develop new features as optional In App Purchases, to support future development.</p>
